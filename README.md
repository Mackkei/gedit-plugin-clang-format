# gedit-plugin-clang-format
A simple gedit plugin for formatting C/C++ files using clang-format by a simple keyboard shortcut.

Simply copy these files to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins or /usr/lib/gedit/plugins/ and enable the plugin in gedit.
At the moment, the shortcut is hardcoded to CTRL+SHIFT+F. Only works in C/C++ documents of course.

Dependencies:

	* gedit (tested with 3.16.3)
	* python3 (tested with Python 3.4.3)
	* clang-format

Have fun.
